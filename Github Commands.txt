Generating ssh key and adding it to the ssh agent:

1.Git command to generate ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "VidyakasilingamNTU@gmail.com"(Mail id of git account)

2.# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
> Agent pid 59566

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

3.$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

If your SSH key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.

4.$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

Or open the id_rsa.pub file generated in C:\Users\Vidya and copy the SSH key
Add the SSH key to your account by going to settings and clicking the ssh/gpg in personal settings


Cloning a file :
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:s1vaaeyy/CI6206-IP.git

Creating a branch
git checkout -b Dev_Branch_1_Vid(Branch name)

Another option to create a branch:
Creating the branch git branch branch name
and then switching to the branch using git checkout 

Switching out to a branch
git checkout Dev_Branch_1_Vid

Looking at the files which are present in local but not in the server
git status

Before commiting
Adding the file changes we made to a current changeset
$ git add "Github Commands.txt"(File name)

To add all the files that have been changed to the current changeset
$ git add -a

Commmiting the changeset
 git commit -m "Vidya's first commit"(m stands for message, similar to giving a name for the changeset)

Pushing the changes into the server
Origin specifies the server. Here we are specifying the local branch name and what name has to be given to the branch in the server on commit
$ git push origin Dev_Branch_1_Vid:Dev_Branch_1_Vid


To pull the latest branch from the server:
Move to the branch and then give the command
git pull
